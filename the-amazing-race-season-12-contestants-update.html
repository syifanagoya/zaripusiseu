The two do not appear to be extremely active on social media, but it appears that they were involved in a legal issue in 2019 regarding a common property. As far as we can tell, the case in question involved a property that the two of them jointly owned and that Rachel wanted to sell.</p><p>All of this seems to suggest that things may have worked out well for their relationship, even if it appears that the issue was presumably resolved outside of court. In addition, Rachel said that she gave birth to a boy in May 2023, though she has kept most of the facts of that pregnancy confidential. She is currently a Co-Founder of Cahoots Events and the creator of Rachel Wilkerson Ceramics.</p><h3><span id=Where_Are_Ronald_and_Christina_Hsu_Now>Where Are Ronald and Christina Hsu Now?</span></h3><p>Ronald “Ron” and Christina Hsu competed in the show’s 18th season, also known as The Amazing Race: Unfinished Business, after their outstanding performance as runners-up in season 12 of the competition.

Given their portrayal in the show, we wish the two the absolute best in life and are confident that their incredible relationship has endured.</p><h3><span id=Where_Are_Nathan_Hagstrom_and_Jennifer_Parker_Now>Where Are Nathan Hagstrom and Jennifer Parker Now?</span></h3><p>The CBS series was undoubtedly an amazing experience for Nathan “Nate” Hagstrom and Jennifer Ellen “Jen” Parker, a dating pair. Despite becoming engaged in 2009, the couple quickly chose to permanently split up. In the end, Nate married in April 2015, and he is now the adoring father of identical twin daughters. The joyful parents of two stunning children named Saylor and Taylor, however, are Jen and her partner Michael Taylor.
