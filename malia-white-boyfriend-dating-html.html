The pair who met on season 6 of the Bravo TV series confirmed they’re dating with a kissing photo uploaded on Baker’s Instagram.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Baker, who was the engineer on the show, captioned the picture with a simple black-heart emoji. However, it seems as of this writing it seems Baker's Instagram has been deactivated.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The duo’s <a href=# rel=follow>Below Deck</a>&nbsp;co-stars flooded the comment section, clearly happy for them. Chief stew Katie Flood replied with a fire emoji. At the same time, stewardess Courtney Veale, who seemed overly excited about&nbsp;the PDA photo, commented&nbsp;that Baker “broke the internet” and added an “OMG” alongside&nbsp;some fire emojis. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Last month, Baker posted a birthday tribute for White on Instagram&nbsp;and noted that he loved her in the caption. However, White has not posted any photos of her with her rumored new beau on her account yet.&nbsp;</p><p>White’s new official relationship comes after her breakup with her ex-boyfriend Tom Checketts, a chef on the show.&nbsp;</p><h2>Break up With Tom Checketts</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>In September 2020, White confirmed that she and Checketts had broken up after more than a year of dating. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The reality star took to her Instagram to clarify the status of her relationship with Checketts, noting that since everyone was talking about it,&nbsp;she'd rather her fans heard from her than others.&nbsp;</p><p>She revealed she had split with Checketts and added that the reason behind it was something she wanted to keep private out of respect for him. The breakup was a surprise to many fans who saw how close they were throughout Season 5.&nbsp;</p><p>During&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">part 2 of the season 5 reunion</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen, White&nbsp;revealed she didn’t know their relationship status. However, when asked if she regretted her relationship with Checketts, she shared it was nice to have him there.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Similarly, Checketts explained they were both so busy, they had not seen each other for a few months. However, he added they were still trying to make the relationship work.&nbsp;</p><h2>Cheating Scandal</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Although White did not reveal the cause of their breakup, she divulged the true reason a year after&nbsp;their split.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>During an&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">episode on season 6</a>&nbsp;of the show, White seemed annoyed at getting a phone call from Checketts until she dropped&nbsp;a major&nbsp;bomb. In&nbsp;the confessional, she explained that she hated him and that were plenty of fishes in the sea, particularly ones that “don’t sleep with other fishes.” <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Shortly after, she&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">opened up to Us Weekly</a>&nbsp;about the things that happened between the two of them.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>&nbsp;We were working on different boats. So, it was impossible for us to see each other. And, yeah, he found someone else on his boats, and I didn’t know for a couple of months.</p><p>She added she found out about his cheating “through a friend” before “all hell broke loose” between them. She also noted that Checketts was really sorry and wanted to get back together, but she was not interested.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKWRobaiedahoK2dXZe8urLRopynnF2ZrrW1zaBloaydoQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./max-kepler-and-the-twins-have-a-plan-to-beat-babip-and-raise-his-production-but-will-it-work.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Max Kepler and the Twins have a plan to beat BABIP and raise his production, but will it work?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lindsay-lohans-best-style-moments-since-returning-to-acting-pics.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Lindsay Lohan's Best Style Moments Since Returning to Acting: Pics</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richest-celebrities.html>Warren G Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrissy-teigen-net-worth.html>Chrissy Teigen Net Worth, Husband, Latest News, Age, Parents</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alexis-ohanian.html>Reddit's Co-Founder, Alexis Ohanian is married to the Tennis legend, Serena Williams.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aaron-donald-net-worth.html>Aaron Donald Net Worth : Fines &amp;amp; Lifestyle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./naomi-sablan-a-profile-of-the-american-film-industry-professional.html>Naomi Sablan: A Profile of the American Film Industry Professional</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
