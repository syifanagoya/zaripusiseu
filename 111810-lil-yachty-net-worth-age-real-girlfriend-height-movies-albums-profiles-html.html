Lil Yachty's parents are Shannon and Venita.

However, things did not go very well for Miles while in school; he was teased and bullied by friends for being <i>different</i>. Regardless of this, he kept working on his dream to be a rapper, and when he was not at work or school, he would be networking with other up-and-coming rappers and producers.</p><p class=align-left>After he graduated from high school, Miles went to New York to look for his big break. He would couch surf at friends' houses, but New York is expensive, and he ran out of money. His best option at the time was to go to college, and he attended Alabama State University.</p><p class=align-left>Unfortunately, college proved to be another hurdle because he felt misunderstood and disliked by everybody. So he would lock himself up in his room and concentrate on writing music. Eventually, he dropped out after 2 months, and this turned out to be a fantastic choice because he became a viral hit soon after.</p><h2>Career</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/e0a8ddc4214fc545.jpg><p class=align-left>Lil Yachty first went viral in December 2015 after one of his songs; <i>One night, </i>was used in a <a href=#>viral </a>comedy skit.
