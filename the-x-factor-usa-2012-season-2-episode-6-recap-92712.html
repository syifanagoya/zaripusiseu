The night was lackluster, mundane and had some of the worst successful auditions we have ever witnessed on The X-Factor USA.</p><p>The show was saved by 15-year-old <strong>Dinah Jane Hansen</strong> the first contestant of the night with her rendition of “If I Were A Boy” by <strong>Beyonce</strong>. This first time try-out achieved the impossible – she surpassed the vocal ability of one of the most intricate female vocalists in the current music industry. &nbsp; What did you think about last night’s performances?&nbsp; Did anyone stand out for your?&nbsp; Hit the comments and let us know.</p><p>On tonight’s show The X Factor will deliver the last of the audition phase of the competition.
