A rep for the singer reached out to <strong><a href=#>Us Weekly</a></strong> to clarify that the anonymous subject of Manson’s note was not, in fact, the rapper. Us regrets the error.</p><p><strong>Shirley Manson</strong>&nbsp;trashed an enemy on her <a href=#>Facebook</a> page this past weekend, after that person allegedly had sent her a not-so-sweet message about her recent comments.</p><p>Many believed the latest subject of her diatribe to be <strong><a href=#>Kanye West</a></strong>, after Manson famously <a href=#>blasted him last month</a>&nbsp;for his headline-making stunt at the 2015 Grammys, calling out&nbsp;<strong><a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a></strong>'s husband as "petty" and <a href=#>disrespectful to<strong> Beck</strong></a>. West has since owned up to his failure — but it remains unknown whether Manson has let the rapper off the hook.</p><p>"Dear He who shall remain nameless," Manson, 48, wrote on Facebook in her latest update. "It is with great sadness that I read your email today. Clearly you have forgotten or are just generally unaware, that in business it is always wise to be kind and respectful in your day to day dealings with other people. Especially those you have never met. You just never know when you might meet that person who has been at the receiving end of your disrespect for indeed you may have to come on bended knee to that person later on down the line because they hold on to something of value that you need to get your greasy hands on."</p><p>After that opening, Manson then seems to rail against this person for what she sees as hypocrisy. "What alarms me more than anything about your nasty little barbs is that you are in the business of representing artists interests and yet you are clearly unaware that not all musicians are obsessed with the charts or being famous," she wrote. "That some of us do not value ourselves by the number of mainstream 'hits' we have enjoyed. That some of us just enjoy making music and having a long lifespan of a career without having to dance as fast as we can, or be the loudest clown in town or be having to hitch ourselves to the latest ,greatest, freshest sound in order to remain 'on top.'"</p><p>She continued: "There are some of us who just like to live the way WE see fit. Make the music WE feel passionate about. Music that feels authentic to who we are and where we are in our lives. There are even some of us who do not believe that being famous is the holy grail or the answer to a beautiful, meaningful and rewarding life."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Manson also appeared to call out West's high-profile marriage to Kardashian and their lifestyle by asserting that some artists prefer privacy compared to being "chased by paparazzi." She added that these same creative minds "do NOT want to put their family name to some s—ty, poorly made product in order to build a 'brand' and who most definately do NOT want to go out every night, dressed up to the nines to the opening of an envelope."</p><p>She concluded her message with some words on how she plans to lead her life. "SO allow me to make my choices as I see fit without having to endure your childish and un-evolved criticism," Manson wrote. "As you so rightly pointed out, there are plenty of talented people in the world who will sell their grannies to serve your desires. So now then sir, that all said, Go F#CK yourself."</p><p>Manson is not the only public figure West has riled up recently. In the last month, <strong>North West</strong>'s father has also <a href=#>faced off against</a> Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week creator<strong> Fern Mallis</strong>, as well as his ex-girlfriend <strong><a href=#>Amber Rose</a></strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKqhoaKhsrp5zJqlrKeeYsGmuMusZK6mnpa6prCMnqWepaliwbB5xqhknp6WYsawwdGsnKWeXWd9coGYbA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./pewdiepie.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>PewDiePie Age, Height, Parents, Wife, Child, Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./why-kim-kardashian-was-once-banned-from-the-met-gala.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Why Kim Kardashian Was Once Banned From The Met Gala</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richest-celebrities.html>Warren G Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrissy-teigen-net-worth.html>Chrissy Teigen Net Worth, Husband, Latest News, Age, Parents</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alexis-ohanian.html>Reddit's Co-Founder, Alexis Ohanian is married to the Tennis legend, Serena Williams.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aaron-donald-net-worth.html>Aaron Donald Net Worth : Fines &amp;amp; Lifestyle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./naomi-sablan-a-profile-of-the-american-film-industry-professional.html>Naomi Sablan: A Profile of the American Film Industry Professional</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
