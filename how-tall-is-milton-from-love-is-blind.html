Between a high-profile lawsuit, at least one couple’s cut from the final product, and all the drama between various cast members, there’s a clear contender for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">messiest season</a> of Love is Blind.</p><p data-characters=327 data-current-count=682 data-injectable=true>Despite all the chaos, fans absolutely ate up the Netflix show’s latest season. It certainly didn’t follow the course of a typical Love is Blind release, but <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">two couples did make it to the altar</a> in the end. One of them even said “I do,” leaving Milton <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">and Lydia</a> as the only successful match of season 5.</p><p data-characters=330 data-current-count=330 data-injectable=false>They sure had a rough time of it, but the reunion showed that Milton and Lydia really do have what it takes to make their marriage last. They’ll never be short on drama, but audiences are rooting for the new spouses — even if they’re guaranteed to have neck issues later in life, considering that height discrepancy.</p><h2 id=h-how-tall-is-love-is-blind-s-milton data-injectable=false>How tall is Love is Blind‘s Milton?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=630 data-injectable=true>https://www.instagram.com/p/Cw3LbXEvmvt/?hl=en</figure><p data-characters=300 data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>James Milton Johnson IV was an early standout in Love is Blind season 5, thanks to his clear intelligence, charm, and youth. Most everyone he was matching with, through the early pod episodes, were nearing (or in) their 30s, leaving Milton to navigate the hurdles of a sometimes half-decade age gap.</p><p data-characters=541 data-current-count=841 data-injectable=true>Another hurdle in Milton’s way is his height — but many audiences didn’t realize it at first. In the pods, when discussing things like height with his matches, Milton claimed he was a modest 5’10”. That was clearly never the case, a point that was starkly driven home when the towering engineer came face to face with his far-shorter fiancee. Lydia can’t stand more than 5’6″ — an average height among women — but she’s forced to crane her neck to look into her now-husband’s eyes.</p><p data-characters=541 data-current-count=541 data-injectable=false>That’s because Milton stands at a full, towering, 6’7″. He’s a thoroughly impressive height — and apparently commonly tells people he’s 6’6″ because “it sounds better” — and clearly his height has been an issue before. Whether because many straight women are looking for height, or because he is sometimes too tall, Milton kept his height close to his chest. As a result, he and Lydia are guaranteed to suffer from neck issues later in life, but anything is worth it for love, right?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ypu9Zmq5qknGK2tHnMoqOtp55is7O7zGajqK6VYra0ecGloKecXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./yunjin-kim-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Yunjin Kim Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-peacock-black-friday.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What is Peacock Black Friday?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richest-celebrities.html>Warren G Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrissy-teigen-net-worth.html>Chrissy Teigen Net Worth, Husband, Latest News, Age, Parents</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alexis-ohanian.html>Reddit's Co-Founder, Alexis Ohanian is married to the Tennis legend, Serena Williams.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aaron-donald-net-worth.html>Aaron Donald Net Worth : Fines &amp;amp; Lifestyle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./naomi-sablan-a-profile-of-the-american-film-industry-professional.html>Naomi Sablan: A Profile of the American Film Industry Professional</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
