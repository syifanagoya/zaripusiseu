He's also unhappy with the way he says Shanna Moakler is spending his $18,000 a month in child support, claiming she's spending much of the money on herself, rather than her kids, while they're allegedly sent to school without lunch. It gets worse –&nbsp;according to TMZ, the docs also include accusations that Barker and Moaker's 12-year-old son was "roaming around" Calabasas, CA with a 15-year-old girl, while Moaker didn't know where he was. Drug and gun accusations are also found in the documents, although Barker reportedly isn't specific about the exact nature of the drugs and guns allegedly in the same house that the former couple's kids are currently living.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-188645 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/GettyImages-500149156.jpg alt="Jerod Harris/Getty Images for Knott's Berry Farm" width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-188645 class=wp-caption-text>Jerod Harris/Getty Images for Knott's Berry Farm</p><p>He is specific about his financial concerns, requesting that his $18,000 monthly child support hook be reduced to as low as $2,900, and that his net worth isn't as robust as it used to be –&nbsp;he's not claiming abject poverty, though, admitting to having almost $37 million in assets to his name (for comparison's sake, his net worth as determined by CNW is $45 million).</p><p>As for Shanna Moakler, the TMZ story quotes an anonymous source saying she's "devastated" by Barker's filing, characterizing it as an attempt to "financially destroy" her. Hopefully for the kids' sake another mutually acceptable arrangement will be agreed upon between the two fairly soon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxnDA0Zqtoqtdl66zt8SrZJqrm6h6p7vRZmhmbF2itq24yKilZqugpMK0rctmqq6ooKS%2FtXnRnpuum6SevK97</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./gabriel-gontijo.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Gabriel Gontijo</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tyler-posey-phem-engaged-after-2-years-together-details.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tyler Posey, Phem Engaged After 2 Years Together: Details</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richest-celebrities.html>Warren G Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrissy-teigen-net-worth.html>Chrissy Teigen Net Worth, Husband, Latest News, Age, Parents</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alexis-ohanian.html>Reddit's Co-Founder, Alexis Ohanian is married to the Tennis legend, Serena Williams.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aaron-donald-net-worth.html>Aaron Donald Net Worth : Fines &amp;amp; Lifestyle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./naomi-sablan-a-profile-of-the-american-film-industry-professional.html>Naomi Sablan: A Profile of the American Film Industry Professional</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
