Nancy Wheeler’s best friend, Barbara Holland (Shannon Purser), affectionately known as just Barb, did more than provide context and plot for the first season. She also stole the hearts of viewers around the world. To this day, Barb remains one of the most beloved fan favorite characters in the series, long after her death.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=346 data-current-count=346 data-injectable=false>Since the moment we met her, Barb has provided endless reasons to love her. Her innocence, her dedication to her friendship with Nancy, her classic 1980s outfits — each detail made her more relatable and charming. Even the Television Academy loved her: Shannon Purser earned an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=256 data-current-count=602 data-injectable=true>For that reason, Barb’s death at the hands of the Demogorgon and the Upside Down set off a seismic event of complaints from Stranger Things fans, declaring that Barb deserved the same time and attention Will Byers received from the town of Hawkins.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=381 data-current-count=381 data-injectable=false>We know — even though the show is only in its fourth season, it’s been <strong>six years</strong> and 29 episodes since Barb’s lost her life. Her re-appearance in chapter seven of season four rightfully conjured up memories of her storyline from season one, but the series of events feel a little hazy after all these years. How exactly did she meet her end? Here’s what you need to know.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=h-what-really-happened-to-barb data-injectable=false>What really happened to Barb?</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=681 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=210 data-current-count=210 data-injectable=false>Back in season one, Barb and Nancy were best friends. Nancy, by way of dating Steve Harrington, was fast on her way to the popular crowd, however, which meant Barb was slowly getting elbowed to the sidelines.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=959 data-current-count=1169 data-injectable=true>One night, Nancy convinced Barb to go with her to Steve’s house for a party. Reluctantly, Barb obliged and it was clear she felt uncomfortable the whole night, especially when she was urged to shotgun a beer — about the last thing Barb would voluntarily do. In the process of trying to be cool, Barb accidentally sliced open her hand with a knife. After the party died down and everyone went their own way, Barb was still bleeding. Nancy told her to go home, even though they were supposed to have a sleep over that night, so Barb dejectedly shuffled her feet through Steve’s backyard and sat on the diving board by herself, absentmindedly dangling her feet over the pool. Drops of blood dripped from her still-fresh wound into the tranquil pool beneath her feet. Then the nearby lights flickered and went out. A menacing shadow slowly crept over her shoulder and, right when Barb looked up at the camera, we saw a Demogorgon and the screen went black.</p><p data-characters=331 data-current-count=331 data-injectable=false>If there was any question as to whether Barb survived the Demogorgon attack, the next episode began with her fighting for her life in the Upside Down. As this was happening, Nancy was getting it on with Steve Harrington in his bedroom — a fact that still haunts Nancy to this day, and serves as a major plot point in season four.</p><p data-characters=407 data-current-count=738 data-injectable=true>Throughout the season, Nancy and Jonathan worked to find out what happened to Barb and Will. Eventually Will’s body turned up, but Barb’s never did. It’s only when Eleven psychically traveled to the Upside Down via a sensory deprivation tank that she saw Barb’s decayed body and knew she was dead. It’s the same decayed body Nancy saw when Vecna lured her into his psychic trance in season four.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=547 data-current-count=547 data-injectable=false>Cries for Barb’s return have echoed through the Stranger Things fandom for years, but unless a new Upside Down entity has the ability to conjure the dead, it’s unlikely we’ll ever see her again. That is, unless it’s in the form of a flashback. We’d much prefer that to some zombie-like reappearance. We love Barb too much to see her as anything other than innocent and happy. It’s truly a testament to both the character and the actress that we still think fondly on her time on the show all these years later.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMCtZKudkaG5unnHmqepnZ6asW7AzmaZmqqSYravedKtqZqml5q%2FbsDHoqWgq18%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./robb-wells-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What is Robb Wells Net Worth 2024: Wiki, Real Name, Age, Height, Family</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tour-crystal-hefners-stunning-hawaiian-home.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tour Crystal Hefners Stunning Hawaiian Home</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richest-celebrities.html>Warren G Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrissy-teigen-net-worth.html>Chrissy Teigen Net Worth, Husband, Latest News, Age, Parents</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alexis-ohanian.html>Reddit's Co-Founder, Alexis Ohanian is married to the Tennis legend, Serena Williams.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aaron-donald-net-worth.html>Aaron Donald Net Worth : Fines &amp;amp; Lifestyle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./naomi-sablan-a-profile-of-the-american-film-industry-professional.html>Naomi Sablan: A Profile of the American Film Industry Professional</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
