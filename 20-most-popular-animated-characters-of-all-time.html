Scooby Doo and Shaggy</h2><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/do.lolwot.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/20-most-popular-animated-characters-of-all-time-6.jpg></p><p>First appearing in “Scooby Doo, Where Are You?” in 1969, Scooby-Doo and Shaggy come in at number 15 on our list.

Eric Cartman</h2><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/do.lolwot.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/20-most-popular-animated-characters-of-all-time-9.jpg></p><p>Creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone unleashed something truly unique when they created Eric Cartman way back in 1997.

Fred Flintstone</h2><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/do.lolwot.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/20-most-popular-animated-characters-of-all-time-15.jpg></p><p>In what could be considered the precursor to Homer Simpson, Fred Flintstone plays the patriarch of the prehistoric Flintstone family.
