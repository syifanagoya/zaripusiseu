NRA Life Member, 2A advocate and owner of many AR rifles + many other rifles, shotguns, and handguns.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Robertson was an adamant supporter of the Second Amendment, according to his social media profiles. <span class=credit>Craig Robertson/Facebook</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Robertson posed with his guns in several photos he posted online. <span class=credit>Craig Robertson/Facebook</span></figure><p>“As Patrick Henry said, so shall I: ‘GIVE ME LIBERTY OR GIVE ME DEATH.’,” the veteran added.</p><p>Robertson’s profile photo on Facebook was an image of him wearing a helmet, goggles and face cover as he pointed a gun with its green laser sight on. Another picture showed him holding up a large rifle while another featured all his guns lined up.</p><p>He had a collection of at least 20 guns, according to Travis Lee Clark, a community member who knew Robertson from working at their local church ward together — but added that that wasn’t out of the ordinary for the area.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">A neighbor estimated that Robertson had a collection of roughly 20 guns. <span class=credit>US Attorney's Office</span></figure><p>Clark said Robertson was an “established icon” in their neighborhood and was often outspoken about his political views.</p><p>“He was a boomer, and he was very political and sometimes made off-color jokes … but nothing that indicated it was a threat,” he said, adding that he was “frail of health.”</p><p>On Facebook, Robertson’s political posts often described violence he wanted to inflict on Democrats, including Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, and <a href=#>prosecutors working on cases against Trump</a>.</p><p>“The time is right for a presidential assassination or two,” Robertson reportedly wrote in a September 2022 Facebook post. “First Joe then Kamala!!!”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Robertson posted frequent threats to President Biden and other top Democrats. <span class=credit>US Attorney's Office</span></figure><p>He also threatened <a href=#>Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg</a>, <a href=#>US Attorney General Merrick Garland</a> and <a href=#>New York Attorney General Letitia James</a>, who are all overseeing cases against Trump.</p><p>“I dreamed I was in a dark corner of a Washington DC parking garage, I was standing over the body of the US Attorney General Merrick Garland with a bullet hole dead center in his forehead,” Roberston wrote in all caps in a chilling February post. “In my hand was my suppressed Smith & Wesson M&P 9mm, smoke wafting from the muzzle.”</p><p>In another post, he described what he wished to do to Bragg.</p><p>“I want to stand over Bragg and put a nice hole in his forehead with my 9mm and watch him twitch as a drop of blood oozes from the hole as his life ebbs away to hell!!” he wrote.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Robertson threatened top prosecutors overseeing cases against ex-President Donald Trump. <span class=credit>US Attorney's Office</span></figure><p>After the FBI was tipped off about Robertson’s online threats, he began targeting the bureau itself.</p><p>“Hey FBI, you still monitoring my social media? Checking so I can be sure to have a loaded gun handy in case you drop by again,” he wrote in one post.</p><p>Despite his detailed and gruesome posts, neighbors said Robertson was a frail, elderly man who used a cane and not someone they considered dangerous.</p><p>“There’s no way that he was driving from here to Salt Lake City, setting up a rifle and taking a shot at the president — 100% no way,” neighbor Andrew Maunder said.</p><p>Biden flew to Utah Wednesday and is scheduled to visit a Veterans Affairs hospital in Salt Lake City Thursday.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Robertson allegedly threatened the president’s life before he was killed by FBI agents attempting to serve a warrant. <span class=credit>US Attorney's Office</span></figure><p>Robertson seemingly spent his whole life in Utah.</p><p>He graduated from Orem High School in 1966 and enlisted in the Air Force in 1970, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the local Fox station</a>. He also attended trade school and Brigham Young University in Provo, his LinkedIn account states.</p><p>He worked as a structural steel and welding inspector for 45 before launching his own business, “Craig’s Custom Woods, LLC,” where he specialized in custom woodworking designs, he wrote on his LinkedIn profile.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Robertson, an Air Force veteran, was married twice and had three adult children. <span class=credit>Craig Robertson/Facebook</span></figure><p>Clark said he was a talented woodworker who carved his own cane.</p><p>The 75-year-old met his first wife, Carol Ann Harrison, at Brigham Young University, where they both were studying. They wed in February 1971 and had three children, two boys and one girl, together before they divorced in 1986, according to Harrison’s 2019 obituary.</p><p>Two years later, Robertson married his second wife, Jackie Christensen Robertson, in May 1988. They had no children and Jackie died in April 2008 at age 58, her obituary states.</p><p>Robertson’s two sons live in Utah, while his daughter is an attorney in Virginia, according to their online profiles.</p><p>The dad of three was charged with disorderly conduct in 1998, to which he pleaded no contest, according to state records. Details about the charge were not available.</p><p>The FBI’s Inspection Division is reviewing the shooting death of Robertson.</p><p>With Post wires</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3FmaXFfrLWwedaaqmabopa2qHnRqJmeqqOpvK951K2YoWWdlrtuv8eoq2aclZaxbrXNZp2boV2nrqqwjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bella-hadid-heres-how-she-feels-about-the-weeknds-upcoming-super-bowl-halftime-show-gig-455750.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bella Hadid Heres How She Feels About The Weeknds Upcoming Super Bowl Halftime Show Gig!</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./larry-fitzgerald-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Larry Fitzgerald Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./richest-celebrities.html>Warren G Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrissy-teigen-net-worth.html>Chrissy Teigen Net Worth, Husband, Latest News, Age, Parents</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alexis-ohanian.html>Reddit's Co-Founder, Alexis Ohanian is married to the Tennis legend, Serena Williams.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aaron-donald-net-worth.html>Aaron Donald Net Worth : Fines &amp;amp; Lifestyle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./naomi-sablan-a-profile-of-the-american-film-industry-professional.html>Naomi Sablan: A Profile of the American Film Industry Professional</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
